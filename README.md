Helloooo! Welcome to my software portfolio :blush:  
My name is Eleni (rhymes with 'a penny') and I am an undergraduate Software Engineering co-op student in my 4th of 5th year. I've recently discovered that I love Web Programming! 

I am currently:

<!---✨ Working on a snazzy personal website (update: put this on hold for a bit - stay tuned!)--->

✨ Contributing to an open source project called OpenTogetherTube, pinned below!
- I hope to continue contributing once the semester craziness dies down!

✨ Dabbling in the wonderfully fun realm of building Discord bots! I'm having SO much fun being creative!
- Trivia Bot, pinned below
- Brock (aka dyc3/discord-pokemon-battles), pinned below

✨ Writing a Reverse Phone Lookup program that is intended for personal use! I will make my repo public once I am confident in its functionality. This will constantly be a work in progress, aimed to be continually improved with the latest technologies and techniques I'm learning. 
- THe program is pretty much complete, but I think I'm going to refactor it to use Vue.js for kicks and giggles

Check out Gyro (pinned below) that I was apart of for a Web Programming course I took at school last year!
