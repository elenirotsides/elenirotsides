Helloooo! Welcome to my software portfolio :blush:  
My name is Eleni (rhymes with 'a penny') and I am an undergraduate Software Engineering co-op student in my senior. I've recently discovered that I love Web Programming! 

❗ I am currently:

<!---✨ Working on a snazzy personal website (update: put this on hold for a bit - stay tuned!)--->

✨ About to start a Software Engineering internship with FreeWheel (Comcast)! I'm super excited to learn and contribute this summer!

✨ Seeking a Full Time job in Software Engineering starting anytime between June 2022 - August 2022. Please reach out to me on LinkedIn (linked to the right under my name) if you'd like to discuss any opportunities.

❗ I hope to:

✨ Continue contributing to an open source project called OpenTogetherTube, pinned below!
- I did a bunch of work on this at the end of 2020! This was my first time contributing to an open source project and I immediately fell in love. I would love to continue work on this project in my free time, and hopefully find more projects to work on in the open source space, as well.

✨ Continue work on Trivia Bot, pinned below!
- There are a bunch of features my group members and I didn't have time to implement (this was originally for a class project) but we'd like to continue work on it and make it even better.

❗ I have:

✨ Dabbled in the wonderfully fun realm of building Discord bots! I'm having SO much fun being creative!

✨ Written a Reverse Phone Lookup program that is intended for personal use! I will make my repo public once I am confident in its functionality. This will constantly be a work in progress, aimed to be continually improved with the latest technologies and techniques I'm learning. 
- The program is pretty much complete, but I think I'm going to refactor it to use Vue.js for kicks and giggles
