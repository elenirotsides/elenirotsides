Helloooo! My name is Eleni (rhymes with 'a penny') and I am an undergraduate Software Engineering co-op student in my 4th of 5th year. I've recently discovered that I love Web Programming and decided to pursue a concentration in it!

I am currently:

✨working on a snazzy personal website (stay tuned!)

✨contributing to an open source project called OpenTogetherTube, pinned below!

Check out my most recent project (see: Gyro, pinned below) that I was apart of for a Web Programming course I just took at school!
