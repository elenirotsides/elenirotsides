Helloooo! Welcome to my software portfolio :blush:  

[![Hits](https://hits.seeyoufarm.com/api/count/incr/badge.svg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Felenirotsides%2Fhit-counter&count_bg=%23000000&title_bg=%23DD00D4&icon=github.svg&icon_color=%23E7E7E7&title=Visits&edge_flat=false)](https://hits.seeyoufarm.com)

My name is Eleni (rhymes with 'a penny') and I am a professional Software Engineer with expertise in Web Programming. I'm also a Discord bot developer of a verified bot, for fun!

## ❗ I am currently:

✨ Maintaining Trivia Bot, my pride and joy! Trivia Bot is a verified Discord bot and contributions are always welcomed! (Please note, a massive update will be coming this summer after I've recovered from the stress my last year of undergrad has kindly bestowed upon me. v13 of `discord.js` was released a while ago, and I intend on updating Trivia Bot to utilize this update!)

## ❗ I have:

✨ Built a restaurant review app for the blind and visually impaired, called [Peer](https://github.com/Peer-Stevens), which was my senior design project! Peer is a cross-platform mobile app written in TypeScript using React Native. (Not reflected in my overall language usage stats below!)

✨ Built Discord Bots!
- Trivia Bot
- Brock (aka `dyc3/discord-pokemon-battles`)

✨ Contributed to an open source project called `OpenTogetherTube`, pinned below!

✨ Designed and developed a website that served as a hub of information in favor of supporting the Referendum to build a new high school which was voted on by Hoboken residents on January 25, 2022. In an archived repository called `morethanahighschool`, pinned below!

✨ Developed a workflow management tool heavily inspired by Trello, called `Gyro`!

✨ Developed a video game wiki website, with an added social element. It is in a repository called `Team-418`, pinned below!

✨ Developed an Exchange Marketplace website for students (think of an e-bay, but for students) called `Exchange4Students`!

<!--✨ Written a Reverse Phone Lookup program that is intended for personal use! I will make my repo public once I am confident in its functionality. This will constantly be a work in progress, aimed to be continually improved with the latest technologies and techniques I'm learning. 
- The program is pretty much complete, but I think I'm going to refactor it to use Vue.js for kicks and giggles-->
