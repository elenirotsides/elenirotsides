Helloooo! My name is Eleni (rhymes with 'a penny') and I am an undergraduate Software Engineering co-op student in my 4th of 5th year. I've recently discovered that I love Web Programming and decided to pursue a concentration in it! At the moment, I am actively seeking summer internship opportunities for 2021 in the software development realm; if you're looking for a highly motivated, passionate, and open minded addition to your team, look no further! Please feel free to contact me through LinkedIn (linked in the left side panel on this page) and I'd be happy to discuss.

I am currently:

✨working on a snazzy personal website (update: put this on hold for a bit - stay tuned!)

✨contributing to an open source project called OpenTogetherTube, pinned below! (My most active project that I'm working on at the moment)

Check out my most recent project (see: Gyro, pinned below) that I was apart of for a Web Programming course I just took at school!
