Helloooo! Welcome to my software portfolio :blush:  

[![Hits](https://hits.seeyoufarm.com/api/count/incr/badge.svg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Felenirotsides%2Fhit-counter&count_bg=%23000000&title_bg=%23DD00D4&icon=github.svg&icon_color=%23E7E7E7&title=Visits&edge_flat=false)](https://hits.seeyoufarm.com)

My name is Eleni (rhymes with 'a penny') and I am an undergraduate Software Engineering co-op student in my senior year. I'm a Discord bot developer of a verified bot, for fun!

## ❗ I am currently:

✨ In my last year of undergrad! I may be slow to respond to PR's/Discussions depending on how busy I get, but I will get to them, I promise! I make an effort to check my notifications several times a week!

✨ Working on [Peer](https://github.com/Peer-Stevens), my senior design project! Peer is a cross-platform mobile naviagation app for the blind and visually impaired.

✨ Maintaining Trivia Bot, my pride and joy! Trivia Bot is a verified Discord bot and contributions are always welcomed! (Please note, a massive update will be coming this winter after I've recovered from the stress the semester has kindly bestowed upon me. v13 of `discord.js` was released a while ago, and I intend on updating Trivia Bot to utilize this update!)

## ❗ I have:

✨ Built Discord Bots!
- Trivia Bot
- Brock (aka dyc3/discord-pokemon-battles)

✨ Contributed to an open source project called OpenTogetherTube, pinned below!

✨ Developed a workflow management tool heavily inspired by Trello, called Gyro!

✨ Developed a video game wiki website, with an added social element. It is in a repository called Team-418, pinned below!

✨ Developed an Exchange Marketplace website for students (think of an e-bay, but for students) called Exchange4Students, pinned below!

<!--✨ Written a Reverse Phone Lookup program that is intended for personal use! I will make my repo public once I am confident in its functionality. This will constantly be a work in progress, aimed to be continually improved with the latest technologies and techniques I'm learning. 
- The program is pretty much complete, but I think I'm going to refactor it to use Vue.js for kicks and giggles-->
