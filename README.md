Helloooo! Welcome to my software portfolio :blush:

My name is Eleni (rhymes with 'a penny') and I am an undergraduate Software Engineering co-op student in my senior year. I've recently discovered that I love Web Programming! 

❗ I am currently:

✨ Starting my last year of undergrad! I may be slow to respond to PR's/Discussions depending on how busy I get, but I will get to them I promise! I will make an effort to check periodically!


❗ I hope to:

✨ Continue work on Trivia Bot, pinned below!
- There are a bunch of features my group members and I didn't have time to implement (this was originally for a class project) but we'd like to continue work on it and make it even better.

✨ Continue contributing to an open source project called OpenTogetherTube, pinned below!
- I did a bunch of work on this at the end of 2020! This was my first time contributing to an open source project and I immediately fell in love. I would love to continue work on this project in my free time, and hopefully find more projects to work on in the open source space, as well.

❗ I have:

✨ Dabbled in the wonderfully fun realm of building Discord bots! I'm having SO much fun being creative!
- Trivia Bot, pinned below
- Brock (aka dyc3/discord-pokemon-battles), pinned below

✨ Developed a workflow management tool heavily inspired by Trello, called Gyro, pinned below!

✨ Developed a video game wiki website, with an added social element. It is in a repository called Team-418, pinned below!

✨ Developed an Exchange Marketplace website for students (think of an e-bay, but for students) called Exchange4Students, pinned below!

<!--✨ Written a Reverse Phone Lookup program that is intended for personal use! I will make my repo public once I am confident in its functionality. This will constantly be a work in progress, aimed to be continually improved with the latest technologies and techniques I'm learning. 
- The program is pretty much complete, but I think I'm going to refactor it to use Vue.js for kicks and giggles-->
