My name is Eleni (rhymes with 'a penny') and I am an undergraduate Software Engineering co-op student in my senior year. I've recently discovered that I love Web Programming!

## ❗ I am currently:

✨ In my last year of undergrad! I may be slow to respond to PR's/Discussions depending on how busy I get, but I will get to them, I promise! I make an effort to check my notifications several times a week!

✨ Working on [Peer](https://github.com/Peer-Stevens), my senior design project! Peer is a cross-platform mobile naviagation app for the blind and visually impaired.

✨ Maintaining Trivia Bot, my pride and joy! Contributions are always welcomed, and also **PARTICIPATING IN HACKTOBERFEST!!!**

## ❗ I have:

✨ Dabbled in the wonderfully fun realm of building Discord bots! I'm having SO much fun being creative!
- Trivia Bot
- Brock (aka dyc3/discord-pokemon-battles)

✨ Contributed to an open source project called OpenTogetherTube, pinned below!

✨ Developed a workflow management tool heavily inspired by Trello, called Gyro!

✨ Developed a video game wiki website, with an added social element. It is in a repository called Team-418, pinned below!

✨ Developed an Exchange Marketplace website for students (think of an e-bay, but for students) called Exchange4Students, pinned below!

<!--✨ Written a Reverse Phone Lookup program that is intended for personal use! I will make my repo public once I am confident in its functionality. This will constantly be a work in progress, aimed to be continually improved with the latest technologies and techniques I'm learning. 
- The program is pretty much complete, but I think I'm going to refactor it to use Vue.js for kicks and giggles-->
